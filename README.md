Project : 5 DOF Robotic Arm

Objective:

The goal of this project was to simulate and program a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Tinkercad. The arm performs basic sweeping movements and holds fixed positions using servo motors and Arduino.

⸻

Materials Used:
	•	Arduino Uno – main controller
	•	5 Servo Motors – to control each joint of the arm
	•	Breadboard – for power and signal connections
	•	Jumper Wires – to connect components
	•	Tinkercad Circuits & 3D Design – for simulation and modeling

⸻

What We Did:
	1.	Designed a 3D model of a robotic arm with 5 movable joints (base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and gripper).
	2.	Connected 5 servo motors to the Arduino using PWM pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10).
	3.	Wrote Arduino code to:
	•	Perform a sweeping motion from 0° to 180°.
	•	Repeat the motion for all motors simultaneously.
	•	Optionally hold a fixed position (e.g., 90°) after the movement.
	4.	Simulated the entire circuit and motion in Tinkercad to test the behavior without physical hardware.

Skills Applied:
	•	Basic electronics (Arduino & servo control)
	•	3D design and simulation
	•	Programming with Arduino IDE
	•	Logical thinking and movement planning
